LLaMA Suggestions:
Based on the provided soil and weather conditions, here are some structured farming suggestions:

**Crop Selection**

* Primary Crop: Rice (as given)
* Secondary Crop: Soybean (complements rice and provides nitrogen fixation)

**Irrigation Method**
Vector 2: **Irrigation Method**

* Best Irrigation Method: Furrow irrigation with drip irrigation system for efficient water use

**Fertilizer Application**

* Fertilizer Type:
        + Nitrogen: Diammonium phosphate (DAP) - 120 kg/ha
        + Phosphorus: Single Super Phosphate (SSP) - 80 kg/ha
        + Potassium: Muriate of Potash (MOP) - 60 kg/ha
* Timing:
        + Basal application at sowing time
        + Split applications during tillering and panicle initiation stages

**Care Tips**
Vector 3: **Care Tips**

* Maintain soil pH between 6.5-7.0 for optimal rice growth
* Monitor rainfall and adjust irrigation schedule accordingly to prevent waterlogging
* Apply 2-3 sprays of fungicides (e.g., tricyclazole) at 10-15 days interval to control sheath blight disease
* Ensure proper drainage system to avoid water stagnation

**Additional Recommendations**
Vector 4: **Additional Recommendations**

* Crop rotation: Alternate rice with soybean or wheat to maintain soil fertility and structure
* Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Implement a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods to minimize pest damage and reduce chemical usage
